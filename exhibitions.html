                        <p>For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our origins.
                            Where do we come from and how
                            did we get here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a framework for
                            exploring and understanding
                            our place in this world.
                        </p>

                            our time. You can also take
                            some time to meet a few of the creatures who didn't survive, including our Woolly Mammoth,

                        <p>From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology are offering us unique

                            improved, thanks to the growth of
                            our understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we visit the history of medicine
                            and take a look at some
                            major breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin and the first heart transplant.
                        </p>
                        <p>Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab, but also from
                            observing animals in the wild.
                            Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.</p>
