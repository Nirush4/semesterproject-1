                            did we get here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a framework for
                            exploring and understanding
                            our place in this world.

                        <h3>Volunteer</h3>
                        <p>A number of people volunteer their time and effort to keep the displays in good order and
                            ready for visitors to come and
                            enjoy...

                            <p>Volunteering has its perks including getting to see behind the scenes of a working
                                museum, access to staff-only
                                lectures, and a monthly lunch where all staff and volunteers come together to discuss
                                ideas
                                for future exhibits and
                                strategies for the museum.You can help volunteer in a number of different spheres.
