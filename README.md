# FED1 Semester Project-1 (The Community Science Museum)

#Goal

Using your new skills writing JavaScript, create an interactive online store to display product from an API endpoint. Use one of the three provided API URLs to display products in HTML and allow users to create a basket of items. You may use your existing cross course project code as a starting point or start a fresh project if this is not available. We recommend using an existing project as styling will not be graded, but is nice to have in the final submission.

## Brief

An interactive science museum called the Community Science Museum is opening in your town/city. Its core target audience is primary and middle school children (ages 7-15) and families with young children.

The website should be informative and engaging, encouraging viewers to visit the museum. It should also be responsive and easy to use on various devices. Peer/Teacher review is recommended.

You have been provided with media assets such as text and images (see link under Resources). You must decide how these will be used in terms of presentation, hierarchy, and design. If any assets are too large, remember to optimize file sizes to ensure smooth loading and a polished user experience.
