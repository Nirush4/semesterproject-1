# FED1 Semester Project-1 (The Community Science Museum)

## Introduction of the semester project-1

For this **semester project-1** I had to create a functional responsive website for **the community science museum**. This website is a vibrant, interactive science museum designed for kids, families, and educators. Its user-friendly layout ensures that visitors of all ages can easily navigate and explore.

With a modern, colorful design, the site aims to captivate and engage younger audiences while also making educators feel inspired and welcome. The visually appealing elements encourage curiosity and excitement about science.

Each page is thoughtfully designed with accessible features, ensuring that everyone, regardless of ability, can enjoy the content and feel included.
