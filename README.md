## Brief

An interactive science museum called the Community Science Museum is opening in your town/city. Its core target audience is primary and middle school children (ages 7-15) and families with young children.

The website should be informative and engaging, encouraging viewers to visit the museum. It should also be responsive and easy to use on various devices. Peer/Teacher review is recommended.

You have been provided with media assets such as text and images (see link under Resources). You must decide how these will be used in terms of presentation, hierarchy, and design. If any assets are too large, remember to optimize file sizes to ensure smooth loading and a polished user experience.

You have the choice to work on this individually or as part of a team of two.
